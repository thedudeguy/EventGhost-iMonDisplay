# EventGhost-iMonDisplay
EventGhost plugin to control an iMON VFD / LCD Display.

Uses the iMON API to send display information to iMON Devices.
Currently only the VFD methods are utilized.

Have only tested on Windows 8.1 x64 with an iMON VFD Display Device.

I really have no idea if the LCD methods will work, since I don't have the LCD device. Therefore, I have no way to test them out.
I did however complete the iMON Wrapper to include all the LCD functions, but no idea if they actually work as intended.
